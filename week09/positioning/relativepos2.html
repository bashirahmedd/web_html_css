                Even there, however, the divorce is not complete <em>and never can be</em>. I've been saying this in
                public presentations for a while now, and it bears repetition here: you can have structure without
                style, but you can't have style without structure. You have to have elements (and, also, classes and IDs
                and such) in order to apply style. If I have a document on the Web containing literally nothing but
                text, as in no HTML or other markup, just text, then it can't be styled.
