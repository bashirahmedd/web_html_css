        <h2>Subheadings</h2>
        <p>It is the case that not every heading can be a main heading. Some headings
            must be subheadings. Examples include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Headings that are less important</li>
            <li>Headings that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
            <li>Headings that like to be dominated</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let's restate that for the record:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Headings that are less important</li>
            <li>Headings that are subsidiary to more important headlines</li>
            <li>Headings that like to be dominated</li>
        </ol>
